## **Project 1: Product Management System**

**Problem Statement:**
Design a **multi-module Python API application** for `Product` `{id, name, qty, price}` with full **CRUD operations** using SQLite. The **client app** should interact with the API and **send an email to the business owner immediately when a new product is created**. Implement **multi-threaded/processed/coroutines operations** to calculate total stock in batches of 10 products, and include a **web scraping module** to fetch product data from e-commerce sites. Ensure **logging**, **exception handling**, and **PEP 8 compliance** throughout the API and client apps.



## **Project 2: Banking System (BS)**

**Problem Statement:**
Develop a **multi-module Python API app** for `Account` `{id, name, number, balance}` with CRUD operations using SQLite. The **client app** should **send an email automatically upon creating a new account**. Implement **multi-threaded/processed/coroutines total balance calculations** in batches and include a **web scraping module** to fetch interest rates or bank information. Ensure **logging**, **exception handling**, and **PEP 8 compliance** across all modules.



## **Project 3: Airline Management System (AMS)**

**Problem Statement:**
Build a **multi-module API application** for `Flight` `{id, number, seats, price}` with CRUD operations via SQLite. The **client app** must **send an email immediately when a flight is added**. Implement **multi-threaded/processed/coroutines revenue calculation** (seats Ã— price) in batches of 10 flights, and include a **web scraping module** to fetch flight prices or availability. All modules should have **logging**, **exception handling**, and follow **PEP 8 standards**.



## **Project 4: Hospital Management System (HMS)**

**Problem Statement:**
Create a **multi-module API app** for `Patient` `{id, name, age, disease}` with CRUD operations using SQLite. The **client app** should **send an email immediately upon creating a new patient record**. Implement **multi-threaded/processed/coroutines patient average age calculation** in batches, and include a **web scraping module** to collect hospital or disease information. Ensure **logging**, **exception handling**, and **PEP 8 compliance** across API and client modules.



## **Project 5: Library Management System (LMS)**

**Problem Statement:**
Design a **multi-module API application** for `Book` `{id, title, price, copies}` with CRUD operations in SQLite. The **client app** should **send an email immediately when a new book is added**. Implement **multi-threaded/processed/coroutines total stock value calculation** in batches of 10 books, and include a **web scraping module** to fetch book prices from online bookstores. Ensure **logging**, **exception handling**, and **PEP 8 compliance**.



## **Project 6: Cab Management System**

**Problem Statement:**
Design a **multi-module API application** for `Cab` `{id, number, type, price}` with CRUD operations using SQLite. The **client app** should **send an email immediately when a new cab record is created**. Implement **multi-threaded/processed/coroutines total cab value calculation** in batches of 10 cabs, and include a **web scraping module** to fetch cab fares from aggregator websites. Ensure **logging**, **exception handling**, and **PEP 8 compliance**.
