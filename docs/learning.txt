Duration: 6 days


Course Description:

    This training program provides a basic introduction to Pythonprogramming language. The focus of this training program willbe more on "PYTHONIC" approach towards problem-solving, focused towards Application Development, Web App development and ML/AI readiness 

Target Audience (who should attend):

  * Engineers who wish to learn python program to developapplications or to 
automate their applications/framework.

  * Engineers who wish to prototype new applications.

Pre-requisites:

  * Participants should be comfortable with the followingtechnologies:

       - Basic programming background with good understanding of programming 
language ingredients that include variables and datatypes, flow control 
statements, and function/procedural programming paradigms.

       - Knowledge of any scripting language would be beneficial.

       - Knowledge of OOP and modular programming concepts in any 
programming language are recommended.

Course Objectives:

  * Understand the basic programming paradigms using Python 2 and Python 3

  * Understand built in data types, variables, functions and flow control 
statements.

  * Learn how to use string, tuple, list, bytearray, set, dictionary types effectively.

  * Learn "pythonic" idioms and anti-idioms.

  * Learn functions, modules and file I/O operations.

  * Learn the basic concepts of OOP in Python.

  * Process, network, automation

* Web scraping and web formats â€“ json, html, xml

  * REST API development using Flask & consuming them

 * Threads, process, & co-routines 



Training mode:

   * The Training program will be mostly demonstration oriented.

   * Most concepts will be taught by demonstrating code and participants are 
expected to learn by practicing the same.


Lab requirements:

   * As the training is highly lab oriented, each participantattending the training 
program must be provided with a computer with the following software 
installed:

       - Windows/Linux/Mac OSX with Python 3.10+ installed.

       - A good programmer's editor (Notepad++ or PSPad on windows,
